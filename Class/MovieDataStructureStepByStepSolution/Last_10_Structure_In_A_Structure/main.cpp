 * Purpose: Movie Data Structure
 *      Step by step Solution
 *      0 - Copy the Template
 *      1 - Read in 1 Set of Data and Verify
 *      2 - Read in N Sets of Data and Verify
 *      3 - Format the Results
 *      4 - Static Structure Array
 *      5 - Change to a Dynamic Char Array inside Static Structure
 *      6 - Dynamic Structure
 *      7 - Fill Structure Function
 *      8 - Display Function for the Structure
 *      9 - Deallocate Memory in a Function
 *      10- Structure in a Structure. Minimize Dependencies
 * Why? Bad time to think of this, but let us combine the Size of the 
 * Structure and the Movie Info into a Structure containing the Array
 * Could have tested this out back around 6) without much potential damage
 * but we can give it a shot and if all else fails go back to 6) and
 * start this final process there.
 * 
 * Note:  This last step literally took me less than 2 minutes to modify
 * the functions.  This is what happens when you have checked out all the
 * previous steps.  Very little room left to make any errors.
